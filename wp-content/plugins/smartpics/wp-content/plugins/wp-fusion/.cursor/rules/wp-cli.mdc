# WP-CLI Development Rules

## Environment
- WP-CLI commands can be executed directly via shell
- WordPress root: ~/Local Sites/dev/app/public

## Usage
Run WP-CLI commands using standard syntax:
```shell
wp plugin activate woocommerce
```

## Common Workflows
1. Testing Plugin Fixes:
```shell
wp plugin deactivate target-plugin
wp plugin activate target-plugin
wp cache flush
```

2. Database Management:
```shell
wp db export pre-test.sql
# Run tests
wp db import pre-test.sql # Reset if needed
```
